# PC ↔ Teensy protocol v1

USB1: CDC ACM `5824:27dd`, 115200 8-N-1, no flow control, DTR asserted.
Baud rate is a CDC setting, not USB throughput. The desktop opens the port natively.
The actuator is on separate USB2 (`04d8:ef4a`).

Requests are ASCII lines terminated by LF, maximum 64 bytes before LF. CRLF also
works. Each request uses a nonzero u32 ID; only one request is in flight at a time.

| Request | Response | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HELLO 1` | `hello`, id 1 | Protocol version, firmware version, board, capabilities |
| `PING 2` | `pong`, id 2 | Teensy uptime; desktop measures round-trip time |
| `SNAPSHOT 3` | `snapshot`, id 3 | Current cached measurements |
| `STREAM 4 0` | `ack`, id 4, stream false | Pause periodic USB1 snapshots |
| `STREAM 5 1` | `ack`, id 5, stream true | Resume snapshots |

Responses are newline-delimited JSON. Example:

```json
{"type":"hello","id":1,"protocol":1,"firmware":"0.1.0","board":"Teensy 4.1","motion":false,"pressure":false}
{"type":"snapshot","id":0,"ms":12500,"epoch":1,"vid":1240,"pid":61258,"mounted":true,"cdc":2,"records":30,"malformed":0,"skipped":0,"values":{"EPOS":{"value":-123,"ms":12450},"STAT":{"value":1344,"ms":12480}}}
```

- ID 0 snapshots are unsolicited, normally 10 Hz. `#` lines are best-effort logs.
- `epoch` changes when actuator cache resets; the UI clears history. `ms` is Teensy
  uptime in milliseconds. Unsigned subtraction handles 32-bit clock rollover.
- `vid`/`pid` are decimal USB2 IDs. `mounted` reports configuration, not freshness.
- `cdc`: 0 closed, 1 opening, 2 open, 3 failed, 4 timed out.
- `records` / `malformed` count decoded / rejected actuator lines. `skipped` counts
  snapshot opportunities coalesced by USB1 backpressure, not lost actuator samples.
- Missing samples are omitted. Retained tags: EPOS, DPOS, STAT, SRNO, SOFT, FREQ,
  TIME, SYNC. Each sample has its own `value` and Teensy reception `ms` timestamp.
- EPOS/DPOS are counts, FREQ is Hz, STAT is a 24-bit word, and TIME is controller
  time in 0.1 ms ticks. SOFT 20103 means firmware 2.1.3.

The UI marks samples older than three seconds stale. The desktop worker also
coalesces unsolicited snapshots while the UI is slow; its separate `coalesced`
counter is exposed by native IPC. All retained lines preserve reception order.
These are monitoring snapshots, not a lossless acquisition stream.

Unsupported input is rejected by both the native command allowlist and firmware.
The firmware sends `{"type":"error","id":0,"message":"invalid command"}` for
malformed commands after LF. No arbitrary forwarding, motion, or sensor commands
exist in this phase. Pausing display updates never pauses actuator reception.
